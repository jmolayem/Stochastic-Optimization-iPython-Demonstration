    "The first components in our loop are fairly straightforward. Note: range() is used in for-loops to state how many times we want to loop. It's not enough to say \"for 'd' in (len(sol/2)) because (len(sol/2)) is an integer and we don't use an integer to establish a for-loop. We use an array of numbers (i.e. [0,1,2,3]). \n",

    "\"d\" then is defined based on this range. So let's say we used s=[1,4,3,2]. (len(sol/2)) makes this 2. range((len(sol/2))) makes this [0,1] which makes 'd' 0 and 1. So, when we get to our 2nd iteration we have origin = people[d][1] that means people[1][1]. Then, that means go to our people array go to the second (2nd) row and second (2nd) column. Use that value. It's 'DAL' --> which is the Dallas airport.\n",

We get to the next line, and flights [(origin,destination)][int(s[1*2])] means pull the origin and destination times and the price for the flights array for the S-row. Here, the S-row will NOT be 2. It'll be the third column whatever our s-vector was. In this case the third column value is 3. So, now we can pull the 3rd row of flights data. \n",

    "Return flight information is defined the same way, but as you would expect we just add one to get the arriving: sol[d*2+1]. This record is defined as our return value. \n",
